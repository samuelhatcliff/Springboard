const myObj = {
    func: whatIsThis

blueDance.call(cat, 'jitterbug');
//this works 

//however, there is a better option that allows us to not have to use call everytime
//it binds it permanently. its called bind!
const bDance = blue.dance;
const boundDance = bDance.bind(blue);

const rocketDance = blue.dance.bind(rocket);

const dog = {
    name: 'Tyson',
    breed: 'Mini Aussie',
    dance: rocketDance
}

//"this" may be problematic when executed through callbacks. 
//ie 
document.querySelector('#btn').addEventListener('click', blue.greet)
//so we can change that to
document.querySelector('#btn').addEventListener('click', blue.greet.bind.blue())
//we can also use bind to bind arguements
const blueDisco = blue.dance.bind(blue, 'disco')
//argument for dance in blueDisco will always be disco

In a sense, js doesn't really have functions. Every function is a method called on an object
But technically, when you call a function on what looks to be nothing (not pertaining to any particular object)
its called on the global object.
The global object in the browser is called the Window Object.
In NodeJs that's global (where some node utilities are)
alert('hey there') === window.altert('hey there')

So what does this have to do with "this"?
-As a shorthand rule, "this" will be set to whatever you have to the left of your dot
the value of this changes depending on how a function is executed.(the value of this isnt
decided until it is executed. the value can change depending on how its executed, as you can see with
the example of cat.dance() vs bluesDance())
