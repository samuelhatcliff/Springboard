What is http?
standard protocol for how browsers and servers communicate
what is a URL?
Universal resource locator. Often made up of the protocol, hostname, port, resource, and query.
What is DNS?
Takes a host name, and translates it into a corresponding IP address (analogous to a phone book)
What is a query string?
optional way of specifying additional information as part of url.
What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
Get: Requests data without side effects (doesn’t change server data). If there are arguments, they are typically passed
along in the query string.
Post: requests with side effects (ie, change data on server) Post does not include arguments using the query string.
Instead, it is usually done using form submissions.
What is an HTTP request?
An http request includes a method (ie get), http protocol version, resource url, and headers.
What is an HTTP response?
An HTTP response is what the server sends back. includes protocol version, status code, and headers.
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP response or request.
Examples of headers within an HTTP request:
Hostnames you’re asking about, date your browser thinks it is, language your browser wants information in, cookies.
Examples of headers within an HTTP response:
Content type (typically text/html for web pages), date/time the server thinks it is, any cookies server wants to set,
caching information.
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
The browser looks up the ip address for the domain name via DNS. The browser sends an http request to the server. The
server sends back a http request. The browser renders html, and sends requests for additional content.
